# Camping-
Camping is when people go outside and live in nature for a short time, usually in a tent. Instead of staying in a house or hotel, you sleep under the sky, cook your own food, and enjoy fresh air. People go camping to relax, feel peaceful, and take a break from busy city life. At night, you may sit around a fire, talk with friends, and look at the stars. Camping helps people feel closer to nature and teaches them how to live simply and calmly.
